This is a starter MkDocs project you can use to seed your own work. Delete and modify anything in this project as needed.

## Requirements

* This project uses an extension called *superfences*, which is part of a larger package called *pymdown*. ServTo render this project as written, run this command from the command prompt (**ctrl** + **`**):

    ```bash
    pip install pymdown-extensions
    ```

    You only need to do that once on your machine, or once per session if you're on a BCIT computer.
